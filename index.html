  <h1>All About Stitch</h1>

  <p> Stitch is one of my favorite disney characters. He is cute, silly, annoying, mean, nice, and loving. He really likes to play around and he acts like a dog. His owner Lilo loves him so much even tho he is a mess. Lilos sister and other people think stitch is a freaky "pet". When he fell from the plane to come to Earth he had four arms, two legs, antenas in his head, and spikes on his back.

  Have you guys ever watched the movie stitch? If you haven't you should watch it. Stitch is one of my favorite Disney Characters. He makes a mess sometimes and Lilo yells at him but than he says "stitch sorry"! Lilo loves him so much but other people don't because he is not a real dog and he is a little naughty. One of my favorite phrases that stitch says is "Ohana means family and family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten" He said that phrase when Lilo got super mad a thim and told him to leave the room.
